# Just My Type

Hello, and welcome to the [Just My Type](http://daneden.me/type) GitHub repository! This repository exists in order to make your life as a contributor and my life as the curator *much* easier.

Anyone can contribute to Just My Type, either by opening a pull request with attached HTML, CSS, and description of fonts that need to be added to the Typekit Kit, or by opening an issue containing just the names of the desired fonts.

Contributors - have fun. But understand that a certain level of quality (which yes, will be biased) and consistency will be maintained. Happy designing.
